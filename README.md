OnPlayerAirbreak
===================

Simple airbreak detection script for SA-MP. Just include it in your mode and you're ready to go!

Callback
===================
There is only one callback included which is called when airbreak is detected.

```
public OnPlayerAirbreak(playerid);
```

This callback is called when a player is either airbreaking on foot, or in a vehicle.
